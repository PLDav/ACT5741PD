Company announces Time Warner merger after DIRECTV and wireless success

AT&T's board of directors continued progressing toward their goal of transforming the company into a global leader by launching DIRECT NOW, an innovative "over-the-top" streaming service. On Oct. 22, 2016, the telecom company announced a stock-and-cash merger with Time Warner Inc. (TWX), a global leader in media and entertainment. Stephenson expects the Time Warner merger to "bring together world-class content with best-in-class distribution," which leads to higher innovation and customer options.

The telecom company's merger with DIRECTV contributed to solid full-year 2016 performance, with over 235,000 U.S. DIRECTV satellite net adds with stable linear TV subscriber base. AT&T had 9.5 million wireless Internet net adds in the U.S. and Mexico, with 2.8 million during fourth-quarter 2016. These net adds contributed to solid wireless operating margin of 24.7% and top fourth-quarter service EBITDA margin of 45.4%.
